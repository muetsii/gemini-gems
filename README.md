# gemini-gems
Gemini Gems configurations, to share and iterate

## How to use?

* Look in this repo for a gem you want to import. They are sorted by language.

* Go to https://gemini.google.com/gems/view

* Click on **+ New Gem**.

* Copy the sections name, description and instructions.

* Add any files you might find relevant (not provided in this repo).

## Why?

I wasn't able to find a way to share Gems, at least without connecting Gemini with my Workspace.

So the best way to share for the moment is to provide the intructions, and allow for PRs to iterate over them.
